# What's this?

Just a fork with no substantial commits, so far.

Github's [Game Off 2015](https://github.com/blog/1972-the-game-has-changed) asks us to start by forking a game. 

I want to play with rogue-like elements, and my digging turned up [skeeto](https://github.com/skeeto)'s [disc-rl](https://github.com/skeeto/disc-rl), which looks like a nice base to start from.

What follows is his original readme text:
