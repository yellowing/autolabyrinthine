## General
- update rot.js
- update jQuery (or replace?)
- clean up Disc-RL things that definitely won't be used
- touchscreen controls
- revise design

## Basic playable steps:
- generate mazelike map with entrance & exit
- update map periodically (don't replace player with wall)
- add player abilities (destroy wall, disable changes in radius)
- add simple endgame conditions & response
- play, consider next steps

## Possible additions:
- seekers
- ghosts
- tie abilities to stats (different costs, single pool, recharge rate)
- declining state (thirst? weakness?)
- flavor text
- items
- traps
